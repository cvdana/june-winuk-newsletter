            Pride Month is here: at WiNUK we believe that neuroscientists should
            be fairly acknowledged for their work and ideas, without facing
            disadvantages due to biases against sex, gender identity, sexual
            orientation or other protected characteristics.<br /><br />
            We are proud to uplift women including trans women in the
            neuroscience community. We are proud to collaborate to provide
            tailored support for our non-binary and gender non-conforming allies
            who may also encounter sexism and/or gender biases in the workplace.
            We are proud to provide education and advice to enable all members
            of the neuroscience community to contribute towards inclusive
            workplaces to the benefit of all.

            This month, we are especially proud to be collaborating with The
            Faculty of Brain Sciences’ LGBTQ+ Committee at University College
            London in coorganising a panel discussion on issues impacting LGBTQ+
            researchers in academia, including interactive audience Q&A. We’re
            keen to hear insightful discussion on navigating neuroscience with
            gender and queer identity intersections. This session will be part
            of the second Annual LGBTQ+ ECR Research Showcase on 26th June 2024.

            Recognising the achievements of LGBTQ+ figures in neuroscience is
            necessary to set role models, highlight their impact on science, and
            contribute to an inclusive and diverse workplace. We’re committed to
            being an organisation which raises awareness and seeks to create
            safe spaces for minorities in this field.

              into the daily lives of neuroscientists, providing valuable
              insights for postgraduate applications, and delving into the
              intricacies of equity in neuroscience, our social media posts have
              resonated with individuals from diverse backgrounds and stages of
              life, united by a shared commitment to gender equity in the field.

              The last week of April was MS Awareness Week. MS
              disproportionately affects women, highlighting the need for
              research to focus on sex differences in neurological diseases. We
              shared educational content during the week as well as an
              informative video on our TikTok.
